### What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal Information include names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.

### No data is collected

All data which is received from the user and processed by Ingantt is stored either in local files on the user's own device, or in the user's own Google Drive account in case the user has explicitly chosen this option and has explicitly enabled this functionality with Google.

Within the Google user's Google Drive storage Ingantt stores the files that the user creates using Ingantt. Ingantt only accesses, uses or shares only the files it creates within the Google user's Google Drive storage.

MPP files opened from the user's device are sent to Ingantt conversion web service to be converted and sent back in XML format. The files are not stored on the service.

Thus, no data is collected by Ingantt developers.

### Data shared with 3rd parties

To enable the AI-related functionality, the prompt entered by the user to create a new file using AI is shared with third-party AI tools: OpenAI and/or Gemini.

No other data is shared with any third parties.

### Data usage

No user data is used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or ML models. This includes the user data obtained through Google Workspace APIs.

### Data protection

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure.

### Policy Updates

This Policy may change from time to time and is available on our website.
