### What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of Personal Information include names, addresses, email addresses, phone and facsimile numbers.

### No data is collected

All data which is received from the user and processed by Ingantt is stored either in local files on the user's own device, or in the user's Google Drive in case the user has explicitly chosen this option and has explicitly enabled this functionality with Google.

MPP files opened from user's computer are sent to Ingantt conversion web service to be converted and sent back in XML format. The files are not stored on the service.

Thus, no data is collected by Ingantt developers.
