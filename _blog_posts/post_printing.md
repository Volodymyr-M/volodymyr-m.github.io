Ingantt is a professional tool built around the idea of scheduling with the use of the well known Gantt chart. Sometimes, once you've used all the comprehensive functionality to build it, you need to show it to someone.

Now you can! Using the new **Printable PDF** main menu item, you can generate a PDF file which can be printed or shared with anyone. The PDF fully reflects the Gantt chart that you see, and uses the same options. For example, if you have chosen for the root summary task to be visible in the **Options** dialog, the printable PDF file also shows it.

The generated PDF can be opened and printed using many available apps, so it's the perfect format not only for printing, but also for sharing with other people using email, messaging or cloud services.
