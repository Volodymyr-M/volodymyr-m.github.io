From the beginning, Ingantt has been a powerful tool for project managers across industries. But only for personal use. That’s changing now!

We’re excited to roll out a major update that lets users share their project plans with others through Google Drive.

It works just like Google Docs or Sheets—you’ll see a familiar Share dialog where you can enter emails and assign roles. The recipients will get a notification from Google Drive, click the link, and instantly access your project plan. Simple!

We’re also introducing significant updates to the Web version, where we believe the sharing feature will be especially valuable. Plus, you can now enjoy a FREE 30-day trial with an easy subscription-based payment model after that.
