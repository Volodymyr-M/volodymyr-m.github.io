Today we're starting to release our biggest update to Ingantt yet.

First of all, AI. Ingantt is one of the first project management tools that has this helpful functionality built-in. How does it work? You can simply provide a description of your project, click a button and get the full project plan! Try it, not only this gives you a good starting point or an inspiration, it's actually fun to use!

But there's more in this update! We've completely redesigned the list of projects, making it visual with thumbnails, and making the integration with Google Drive even tighter. Now with sorting and with some operations like "Export to PNG" available right from the list of your projects.

For some popular types of projects we've added handcrafted templates. One of the templates, "Tutorial Template" is worth mentioning, as it can be a quick way to get started with Ingantt, just read through it, or use it as a starting point.

The update also opens some new opportunities to improve Ingantt in the future, so stay tuned for more!
