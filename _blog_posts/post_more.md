Now Ingantt is available on any platform and has all the features the majority of users expect from a highly functional project planning software. But we are not stopping our work on it. We listen to our users.
There's been quite a lot of great feedback from you and we appreciate it! We keep updating Ingantt with the improvements we've learned from you.

In recent builds Ingantt has received

* the ability to reorder Task columns
* smoother keyboard shortcuts experience
* scrollbars visible by default in some grids
* better indication of % complete inside tasks on the Gantt chart

as well as some internal improvements and optimizations.

Please feel free to contact us with your feedback, questions or comments. Let's make Ingantt better together!
