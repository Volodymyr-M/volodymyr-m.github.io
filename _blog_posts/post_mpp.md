We're excited to announce an update to Ingantt that adds an important feature!

As you might have already known, Ingantt supports opening of XML files created by Microsoft Project. But this format is not native to this popular application which normally saves its files in its own binary format called MPP (files with ".mpp" extension).

The new update adds the ability to open MPP files just like you would open XML files. Just choose an MPP file in the file picker and it opens.

There's one thing to remember about this feature. Unlike most of Ingantt functionality which does not require Internet connection, opening of MPP files requires a working Internet connection as such files are sent to our service for conversion to XML. The exchange of data is done through a secure connection, and the files are not stored on the service, so no worries about privacy and security.

We hope you enjoy this new feature of Ingantt as much as we do. More new features are on the way!
