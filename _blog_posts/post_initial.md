After many months of hard work Ingantt is finally ready!

Ingantt is the result of our vision of a user friendly alternative to Microsoft Project, affordable and available to everyone regardless of the device used. Suitable for planning of most projects possible, Ingantt is a useful tool for everyone who has a number of tasks to plan beyond a traditional task list.

Excellent for big or small renovation projects, software development projects, small construction projects, weddings, events, anything requiring planning, Ingantt is valuable to answer the most important questions: when the project ends and each of its task end and how much they all cost? All while taking into account holidays, vacations and all other important data impacting your project's schedule and cost.

Unlike some of the planning tools, Ingantt makes you feel productive. We have reduced the amount of clicks the most common actions require. Besides the traditional split view with tasks on the left and the Gantt chart on the right (and editing through dialogs), we've also added a special Editing view to Ingantt for you to be able to set up your schedule in a Photoshop-like manner, where your changes are immediately reflected in the schedule, visible in the Gantt chart and there's no need to open dialogs at all.

If you are familiar with tools like Microsoft Project, you can use your existing skills and get started quickly. If you're not, we have created a comprehensive [documentation]({{ site.data.const.docs_url }}) and a [Getting Started guide]({{ site.data.const.docs_url }}/getting-started/).

As a modern app, Ingantt supports Dark mode. To make it easier to have your files in the cloud, Google Drive support is fully available, you can store, save and open your Ingantt files on your Google Drive.

With Windows and Android support, Ingantt has been released to [Microsoft Store]({{ site.data.const.windows_url }}) and on [Google Play]({{ site.data.const.android_url }}). There's also a [Web version]({{ site.data.const.web_url }}) available.

Please feel free to contact us with your feedback, questions or comments. The first version is out, but our work on Ingantt continues with more features on the way. So stay tuned!
